`std.algorithm.sorting.schwartzSort` supports binary transform functions too

The `transform` template parameter of $(REF schwartzSort, std, algorithm, sorting)
isn't restricted to unary functions taking an element anymore, but can
also be a binary function taking an element and its index in the
original range.

The original index can therefore be used when computing the transformed
value to sort by.
